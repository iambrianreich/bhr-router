 * uses WeakMap keyed by HTTP verb, while inner storage uses arrays to prevent
 * route objects from being garbage collected. It matches incoming requests to
 * routes based on the HTTP verb and path, iterating through registered routes
 * until a match is found. If no match is found, it throws an exception.
